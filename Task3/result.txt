Analysis of Nagle's Algorithm and Delayed ACK Effect:
1. Nagle's algorithm aims to reduce small packet overhead by buffering small segments.
2. Delayed ACK reduces ACK traffic by acknowledging multiple segments at once.
3. When both are enabled, they can create a 'deadlock' causing delays.
4. Disabling Nagle's algorithm improves responsiveness for interactive applications.
5. Disabling Delayed ACK improves response time but increases network traffic.
6. The configuration with both disabled typically provides the best responsiveness
   but may not be the most network-efficient option.
